programs ive ever made!

doIT is a simple program made in C
to fix and upgrade your debian based linux system!
its **only for if the system is borken** do not use
if your system is **not broken or just needs a simple fix!**
it comes with the raw **doIT.c** file, but also comes with
a **doIT.runME** file witch is just a x86_64 linux
executeable that i renamed!

1. go into the SAME folder as doIT.runME
and then type "chmod +x doIT.runME".

2. run this in your terminal to
install what the program needs!
**"sudo apt install build-essential"**

4. when your ready to run type
"./doIT.runme" and the program will
start and wait 12 seconds THEN start.

# !!THINGS TO NOTE!!
DO NOT RUN THIS PROGRAM ON NON-DEBIAN BASED
LINUX SYSTEM OR NON-LINUX SYSTEMS!

"sudo apt autoremove --purge".
This can **delete packages and files permanently**.
